    "# find-bug\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "Your customer claims that there is a bug in application. The word jackass is being displayed on main screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "He can not tell when the word appeared the first time. However, he is sure that there was no jackass in the version 1.0 of the application. He want you to find who has added this and fix it ASAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the task is not so simple. It turns out that the home screen text is encoded in source code with base64 algorithm for sanity reasons. It is impossible to search for commit that introduces this swearword with git log -S command. What's more, the text in home screen has been changed in the last 300 commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to find the first commit that introduces the jackass word and push it for verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Justification\n",
    "Normally you don't face base64 encoded strings that you need to search in. However, this perfectly simulates common situation when something were working back then but now is broken. You often can't even tell where and when the bug could be introduced. In real life you would write an unit test that verifies if the bug exists. This would help you to find a commit introducing bug dramatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Useful tips\n",
    "First of all, you don't want to search for jackass commit by hand.\n",
    "You can find last known working (no jackass) version of the project by 1.0 tag.\n",
    "You can decode contents of the home page text with the following command\n",
    "\n",
    "openssl enc -base64 -A -d < home-screen-text.txt\n",
    "grep can help you verify whether the decoded content contains jackass or not. It's worth to know the grep -v option that inverts default grep behavior - returns status code 0 if the word has not been found and 1 otherwise\n",
    "\n",
    "you can run any command in shell with sh -c \"any command\"\n",
    "Use informations above to create a simple unit test that would help to automate searching for a first commit with bug\n",
    "When you find the first commit with jackass, you can push it for verification with the following command\n",
    "\n",
    "git push origin COMMIT_ID:find-bug\n",
    "The easiest solution\n",
    "git bisect start\n",
    "git bisect bad HEAD\n",
    "git bisect good 1.0\n",
    "git bisect run sh -c \"openssl enc -base64 -A -d < home-screen-text.txt | grep -v jackass\"\n",
    "Further info\n",
    "git bisect is an amazing tool that helps you to find commit that introduced a bug. Once you are able to write a script that verifies if the bug exists, the task is even simpler as git bisect allows you to automate searching for buggy commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a shell command that verifies if the bug exists (you should have figure out one with openssl and grep for this task), you can automate searching for bug with\n",
    "\n",
    "git bisect run sh -c \"your command\"\n",
    "\"your command\" should return status code 0 for good commits and non-zero for bad commits. It can be running an unit test for example. If you marked last known good and bad commits before, git bisect will run and find the commit that introduced a bug in seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can't automate it, git bisect is also helpful because it helps to binary search for a buggy commit, checking out the next closest hit. You can run the application on it and verify by hand if the bug exists or not, marking narrower scope for further searching on each iteration.\n",
